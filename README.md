# SQL-Data-Warehouse-Project 🏗️

## Project Overview
This project is a detailed, hands-on implementation of a modern **SQL Server-based Data Warehouse**, designed to showcase my learning and expertise in data engineering, ETL processes, data modeling, and analytics. The project follows the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) to ensure a structured, scalable, and maintainable approach to data management. It serves as a portfolio piece to demonstrate my ability to design, build, and document a fully functional data warehouse from scratch.

## Project Requirements
The project is driven by the following key requirements:

- **📥 Data Ingestion**: Integrate data from multiple sources, including **CRM**, **ERP**, and **CSV files**, into the **Bronze Layer** for raw data storage.
- **🔄 Data Transformation**: Clean, standardize, and enrich data in the **Silver Layer** to ensure data quality and consistency.
- **📊 Business-Ready Data**: Prepare refined, aggregated, and business-logic-applied data in the **Gold Layer** for analytics and reporting.
- **📄 Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation, including data architecture diagrams, data flow diagrams, and a data catalog.
- **🔧 Version Control**: Use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control and collaboration, ensuring a well-structured and organized repository.
- **✅ Validation**: Implement data validation checks at each layer to ensure data completeness, correctness, and integration accuracy.
- **🚀 Scalability**: Design the data warehouse to be scalable and adaptable to future business needs.
