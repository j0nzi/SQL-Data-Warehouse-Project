# SQL-Data-Warehouse-Project
Project Overview
This project is a detailed, hands-on implementation of a modern SQL Server-based Data Warehouse, designed to showcase my learning and expertise in data engineering, ETL processes, data modeling, and analytics. The project follows the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) to ensure a structured, scalable, and maintainable approach to data management. It serves as a portfolio piece to demonstrate my ability to design, build, and document a fully functional data warehouse from scratch.

# Project Requirements
The project is driven by the following key requirements:

Data Ingestion: Integrate data from multiple sources, including CRM, ERP, and CSV files, into the Bronze Layer for raw data storage.

Data Transformation: Clean, standardize, and enrich data in the Silver Layer to ensure data quality and consistency.

Business-Ready Data: Prepare refined, aggregated, and business-logic-applied data in the Gold Layer for analytics and reporting.

Documentation: Maintain comprehensive documentation, including data architecture diagrams, data flow diagrams, and a data catalog.

Version Control: Use Git for version control and collaboration, ensuring a well-structured and organized repository.

Validation: Implement data validation checks at each layer to ensure data completeness, correctness, and integration accuracy.

Scalability: Design the data warehouse to be scalable and adaptable to future business needs.

# Project Phases
The project is divided into the following phases, each with specific tasks and deliverables:

1. Requirements Analysis
